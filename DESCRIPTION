Description: Provides low-level access to 'GDAL' functionality for R packages. The aim is to minimize
  the level of interpretation put on the 'GDAL' facilities, to enable direct use of it for a variety of purposes. 
  'GDAL' is the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' a translator for raster and vector geospatial data formats 
  that presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application 
  for all supported formats <http://gdal.org/>. Other available packages 'rgdal' and 'sf' also provide access to 
  the 'GDAL' library, but neither can be used for these lower level tasks, and both do many other tasks.
